# Cryptopal Challenge Solutions - Set 1

This repository contains my solutions for the first set of the Cryptopal Crypto Challenges.

## Description

The Cryptopal Challenges provide a structured way to learn practical cryptography through hands-on coding exercises. Set 1 focuses on building foundational skills and is designed as a qualifying step for those interested in delving deeper into cryptography.

## Instructions

**Prerequisites**

* A C++ compiler
* Basic familiarity with C++ concepts

**Building**

1. `make` - Compiles the solutions.

**Running**

2. `./output` - Executes the solutions (assumes build was successful).

**Cleaning**

3. `make clean` - Deletes object files and executables.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are for personal learning and exploration. For real-world cryptographic applications, always use well-vetted and professionally maintained libraries.
